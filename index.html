            This image is from their website. 
            Some things to note are the vivid colors that all seem to pull for your attention,
            the video that makes it hard to read the main text,
            the buttons with mismatched colors.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        I addressed these issues with a restyling of the page. I wanted to keep the overall message the same.
        I wanted to keep a similar color profile, but to elevate the trust of the person using the webpage. 
        Instead of banners vying for your attention, I wanted less movement which communicates stability.
        I wanted softer colors, that seem less harsh and more inviting. 
        I wanted a font that established that this company is serious and professional.

        After editting the site and taking away what detracted from it, and editing the UI to be a more consistent experience,
        here is the result:

    <div class="item">
